# Homework-3

When you open my website you are presented with a box that will hold a generated password and a button that will generate that password for you.

There is a slider and number function that lets you choose the number of characters you want in your password. 

Once you click generate password a series of alerts pops up to ask if you want lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters or numbers.

Currently there is a bug when you want to allow all of the character options it only does some of the choice you made.
